# bob
C project struct (Makefile/include/src + wise words)

If you are way too lazy to make your own project structure / makefile, just ask bob :) 

need : 
lib/my/ directory in your home directory
proverbes in your home directory
(again, you can change which file/path you use to get to your lib / proverbes.)

use : 
in your directory : 
bob project_name 

Feel free to put as many wise words as you want inside the proverbes folder :)
